I’ve combined the two versions into one comprehensive, high-quality `README.md`.

I prioritized the professional structure of your first version while integrating the specific pathing (`apps/careconnect_react_native`) and the detailed accessibility feature list from the second student's version. This ensures that Dr. Minagar sees both the technical rigor (coverage stats) and the feature completeness (accessibility list) required for the grade.

# CareConnect React Native (Expo) Implementation

**Team 4 | SWEN 661 - Spring 2026** **Instructor: Dr. Minagar**

## 📖 Overview

CareConnect is a cross-platform healthcare mobile application built with React Native (Expo). This project demonstrates feature parity with our previous Flutter implementation while leveraging the React ecosystem for robust, cross-platform healthcare management.

This application supports distinct caregiver and patient roles and was developed with assistance from AI (LLM) to optimize component structure and test coverage.

## 🚀 Features & Parity

All core functionalities from the Flutter application have been successfully ported:

* **Dual-Role Dashboards:** Specific, state-driven interfaces for Caregivers and Patients.
* **Offline Tracking:** Mood Tracking, Symptom Tracking, and Medication Logging (persisted via `AsyncStorage`).
* **Manual Calendar:** Manual entry logging for medical visits and events.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized layouts for both phone and tablet form factors using custom responsive hooks.

## ♿ Accessibility Features (LO1 Compliance)

CareConnect prioritizes accessibility to satisfy learning objective LO1:

* **Theme Support:** Light, Dark, and System theme switching.
* **Visual Aids:** High contrast mode and reduced motion support.
* **Text Scaling:** Adjustable text size integrated into a custom `ThemeProvider`.
* **Assistive Technology:** Support for screen readers and voice feature toggles.
* **UI Design:** Large touch targets and explicit accessibility roles/labels on all interactive components.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React Native (Expo Managed Workflow)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Navigation:** React Navigation (Native Stack)
* **State Management:** Zustand
* **Persistence:** `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
* **Testing:** Jest & React Native Testing Library (RNTL)

## 🧪 Testing & Code Coverage

Team 4 has achieved the required code coverage (min. 60%) using Jest and RNTL.

### Running Tests

To verify the test suite and generate the coverage report:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage

# OR

npx jest --coverage

```

The report is auto-generated and can be viewed at: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

### Current Coverage Stats

| Metric | Result | 
| --- | --- |
| **Statements** | **67.23%** |
| **Lines** | **69.13%** |
| **Functions** | **58.94%** |

## 📦 Build Instructions

The application is prepared for EAS (Expo Application Services) for production-ready builds.

* **Android (APK):** `npm run build:android` (Generates a preview APK)
* **iOS:** `npm run build:ios`

## 🔐 Security & Quality

* **Static Analysis:** ESLint with `eslint-plugin-security` to detect potential vulnerabilities.
* **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript configuration (`npm run typecheck`).
* **Dependency Audit:** Regular checks via `npm audit`.
